# FRB Cistercian

FRB Cistercian is an OpenType font for the medeival number system known as the [Cistercian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercian_numerals).

This font was inspired by Kirk Miller's Unicode document [L2/20-290](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20290-cistercian-digits.pdf).

This font currently uses the Private Use Area, as these characters are not yet in Unicode. See `codepoints.tsv` and `codepoints.txt`.
